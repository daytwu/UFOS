# UFOS

### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  
  The purpose of this project is to have a head-dive into using Javascript and its tools along with HTML for Dana, a UFO enthusiast, so that others may have a quick and easy peak into UFO sighting datas in the form of a webpage and its easily navigatable search table.
  
### Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

In the above image, the date section is filled in for the date filter. This automatically detects, filters and populates the webpage based on the entries in the Filter Search. This differs from our initial webpage design in which a filter button must be clicked in order for the script to start processing what to filter.

This image shows the filter set to a specific state instead of the date. This is an additional filter criteria that we implemented for the new webpage, along with City, Country and Shape. Mupltiple criteria can be set at the same time for more specific filtering as well. The search detection also function just like when having only the date selected, it will automatically populate the selected criterias as soon as a change is detected.


### Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
